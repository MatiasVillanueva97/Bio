# * EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
# cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
# representation of the EGF-like domain:

# Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
# prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
# (EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
# chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
# pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
# called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
# involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
# or steroid biogenesis.
# 
# In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
# the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.
# 
# There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
# first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
# formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
# extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
# condensation reaction.
# 
# Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
# carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
# a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
# found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
# the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
# to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
# [4].
# 
# We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of

# 
# Ferredoxins  are small, acidic, electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous
# in  biological  redox  systems.  They  have  either  4Fe-4S, 3Fe-4S, or 2Fe-2S
# cluster.  Among  them,  ferredoxin  with  one  2Fe-2S cluster per molecule are
# present  in  plants, animals, and bacteria, and form a distinct 2Fe-Ferredoxin
# family  [1,2].  They  are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four
# conserved  cysteine  residues  to  which  the  2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This
# conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for example <PDB:4FXC>) [3]. The domain is classified as a beta-grasp which is
# characterized  as  having  a beta-sheet comprised of four beta-strands and one
# alpha-helix  flanking  the  sheet  [4].  The  two  Fe  atoms  are  coordinated
# tetrahedrally by the two inorganic S atoms and four cysteinyl S atoms.
# 
# Some proteins that contains a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain are listed below:
# 
#  - Ferredoxin from photosynthetic organisms;  namely plants and algae where it

# ***************************************************************************
# 
# Ferredoxins  [1]  are a group  of  iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron
# transfer in  a  wide variety  of   metabolic  reactions.   Ferredoxins  can be
# divided into several subgroups  depending upon the physiological nature of the
# iron-sulfur  cluster(s).   One of these  subgroups are the 4Fe-4S ferredoxins,
# which  are  found  in   bacteria  and  which   are thus  often    referred  as
# 'bacterial-type' ferredoxins.  The structure of these proteins [2] consists of
# the duplication of a  domain of twenty six amino  acid residues; each of these
# domains contains four cysteine residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for  example <PDB:1FDN>) [3]. The clusters consist of two interleaved 4Fe- and
# 4S-tetrahedra  forming  a  cubane-like  structure, in such a way that the four
# iron  occupy the eight corners of a distorted cube. Each 4Fe-4S is attached to
# the polypeptide chain by four covalent Fe-S bonds involving cysteine residues.
# 
# A number  of  proteins  have  been found [4]  that  include one or more 4Fe-4S
# binding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins
# are  listed  below:
# 
#  - The iron-sulfur proteins  of  the succinate  dehydrogenase and the fumarate
#    reductase  complexes (EC 1.3.99.1).  These  enzyme   complexes,  which  are
#    components of the tricarboxylic  acid cycle, each contain three subunits: a
#    flavoprotein,  an iron-sulfur protein,  and a b-type cytochrome.  The iron-
#    sulfur proteins contain three  different  iron-sulfur  centers: a 2Fe-2S, a
#    3Fe-4S  and a 4Fe-4S.
#  - Escherichia coli anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5)
#    This enzyme is composed of three subunits: A, B, and C. The C subunit seems
#    to be an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-
#    terminal part of the  protein.
#  - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.  The  B subunit of
#    this  enzyme  (gene dmsB)  is  an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  four  4Fe-4S
#    ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Escherichia coli  formate  hydrogenlyase.  Two   of  the  subunits  of this
#    oligomeric complex (genes hycB and hycF) seem  to  be  iron-sulfur proteins
#    that each contain two 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Methanobacterium formicicum formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). This enzyme
#    is used by the archaebacteria  to grow on formate.  The  beta chain of this
#    dimeric enzyme probably binds two 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - Escherichia  coli  formate  dehydrogenases  N  and O (EC 1.2.1.2). The beta
#    chain  of these two enzymes (genes fdnH and fdoH) are  iron-sulfur proteins
#    with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Desulfovibrio periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase (EC 1.18.99.1).  The large chain
#    of this dimeric enzyme binds three 4Fe-4S centers, two of which are located
#    in the ferredoxin-like N-terminal region of the protein.
#  - Methanobacterium  thermoautrophicum  methyl  viologen-reducing  hydrogenase
#    subunit mvhB, which contains six  tandemly repeated ferredoxin-like domains
#    and which probably binds twelve 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - Salmonella typhimurium anaerobic sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) [5]. Two of
#    the subunits of  this enzyme (genes asrA and asrC) seem  to  both  bind two
#    4Fe-4S centers.
#  - A Ferredoxin-like protein  (gene fixX)  from  the  nitrogen-fixation  genes
#    locus of various  Rhizobium  species,  and   one  from  the  Nif-region  of
#    Azotobacter species.
#  - The 9 Kd  polypeptide  of chloroplast photosystem I [6]  (gene psaC).  This
#    protein contains two low potential 4Fe-4S centers, referred as  the A and B
#    centers.
#  - The chloroplast frxB protein which is predicted to carry two 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - An ferredoxin  from a  primitive  eukaryote,  the enteric amoeba  Entamobea
#    histolytica.
#  - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  yjjW, a protein with a N-terminal
#    region belonging to the radical activating enzymes family (see <PDOC00834>)
#    and two potential 4Fe-4S centers.
# 
# The  pattern  of  cysteine residues in the iron-sulfur region is sufficient to
# detect  this class of 4Fe-4S binding proteins. The profile we developed covers
# the whole domain.

# 
# The insulin-like growth factors  (IGF-I and  IGF-II) bind to  specific binding
# proteins in extracellular fluids with high affinity [1,2,3]. These IGF-binding
# proteins (IGFBP) prolong  the half-life  of the  IGFs and have  been shown  to
# either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on  cells
# culture.  They  seem  to alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface
# receptors. The  IGFBP  family comprises six proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6) that bind
# to IGFs  with  high  affinity.  The  precursor  forms  of  all six IGFBPs have
# secretory signal  peptides.  All IGFBPs share a common domain organization and
# also a  high  degree  of  similarity  in  their primary protein structure. The
# highest conservation  is found in the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions.
# Twelve conserved  cysteines  (ten  in  IGFBP-6)  are  found  in the N-terminal
# domain, and six are found in the C-terminal domain. Both the N- and C-terminal
# domains participate  in  binding  to IGFs, although the specific roles each of
# these domains in IGF binding have not been decisively established. In general,
# the strongest  binding  to  IGFs  is shown by amino-terminal fragments, which,
# however bind  to  IGF  with  10-  to 1000-fold lower affinity than full length
# IGFBPs. The  central  weakly  conserved  part  (L domain) contains most of the
# cleavage sites for specific proteases [4,5].
# 
# The N-terminal  domain  is  ~80 residues in length and has an L-like structure

# a short  stretch  of amino acids. The two subdomains are perpendicular to each
# other, creating the "L" shape for the whole N-terminal domain. The core of the
# first subdomain  presents a novel fold stabilized by a short two-stranded beta
# sheet and   four  disulfide  bridges  forming  a  disulfide  bond  ladder-like
# structure. The  beta  sheet and disulfide bridges are all in one plane, making
# the structure  appear  flat from one side like a "palm" of a hand. The palm is
# extended with  a "thumb" segment in various IGFBPs. The thumb segment consists
# of the  very N-terminal residues and contains a consensus XhhyC motif, where h
# is a  hydrophobic amino acid and y is positively charged. The second subdomain
# adopts a  globular  fold whose scaffold is secured by an inside packing of two

# *******************************************************
# 
# Integrins [1,2] are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell
# to cell as well as cell to matrix adhesion. Some integrins recognize the R-G-D
# sequence in their extracellular matrix protein ligand. Structurally, integrins
# consist of a dimer of an alpha and a beta chain.  Each  subunit  has  a  large
# N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short
# C-terminal cytoplasmic  region. Some receptors share a common beta chain while
# having different  alpha chains.  The  sequence  of  a number of different beta
# chains has been determined and are listed below:
# 
#  - Integrin beta-1, which  associates with alpha-1 to form a laminin receptor,
#    with alpha-2 to form a  collagen receptor, with  alpha-4  to  interact with
#    VCAM-1, with alpha-5 to form a fibronectin receptor, and with alpha-8.
#  - Integrin beta-2, which  associates with alpha-L (LFA-1)  to  interact  with
#    ICAM-1, and with alpha-M (MAC-1) or alpha-X  (p150,95) to form the receptor
#    for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
#  - Integrin beta-3, which associates with alpha-IIB  to  form  a  receptor for
#    fibrinogen,  fibronectin,  vitronectin and VWF, and with alpha-V  to form a
#    vitronectin receptor.
#  - Integrin beta-4, which associates with alpha-6.
#  - Integrin beta-5, which associates with alpha-V.
#  - Integrin beta-6 [3].
#  - Integrin beta-7 [4].
#  - Integrin beta-8, which associates with alpha-V [5].
#  - The Drosophila myospheroid protein, a probable integrin beta chain.
# 
# All the integrin beta chains contain four repeats of a forty amino acid region
# in the C-terminal extremity of their extracellular domain. Each of the repeats
# contains eight  cysteines.   We have developed a pattern from a section of the
# repeated region that includes five of these conserved cysteines.

# Defensins [1   to   5],  also  known  as  alpha-defensins,  are  a  family  of

#    lectin and a VWFC domain.
#  - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.
# 
# Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
# which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
# but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
# other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
# might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].
# 
# The profile we developed covers the entire VWFC domain.
